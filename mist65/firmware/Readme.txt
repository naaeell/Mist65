To flash, press and hold the boot button on the RPI2040 Zero while plugging in the USB until it is detected on the computer as a new drive.
then drag and drop the file with the .uf2 extension onto the drive, or you can also copy and paste it into it.
Wait a few moments until the keyboard is detected.
To use via (unfortunately it hasn't been merged into the branch yet), we need to go to the url https://usevia.app/ then go to the gear icon and turn on the show design tab option.
Once active, open the brush icon next to the gear. Click load on the load draft definition menu and enter the via.json file in the firmware folder.
Go back to the configuration menu and click on device authorization, your keyboard will appear and is ready to use.
