## Flashing Firmware

- Flash the RPI2040 Zero by pressing and holding the boot button while plugging in the USB until it's detected on the computer as a new drive.

- Drag and drop or copy and paste the file with the .uf2 extension onto the drive. Wait until the keyboard is detected.

#### Unfortunately, the VIA support hasn't been merged into the branch yet. However, to use it, follow these additional steps:

- Visit https://usevia.app/ and navigate to the gear icon, then enable the "Show Design Tab" option.
- Once active, open the brush icon next to the gear. Click "Load" on the "Load Draft Definition" menu and input the via.json file located in the firmware folder.
- Return to the configuration menu, click on "Device Authorization," and your keyboard will appear, ready to use.

Choose "Mist65_via" for VIA support or "Mist65_default" for the default keymap without VIA support.
