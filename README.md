Introducing Mist65, a 65% custom keyboard inspired by [bakeneko65](https://github.com/kkatano/bakeneko-65). The PCB, aptly named Mist, features a sleek black design reminiscent of nighttime fog. To keep costs reasonable, the ATmega32u4 controller has been replaced with the budget-friendly RP2040 Zero, maintaining similar functionality.

Designed with a 65% layout, Mist65 strikes a balance between compactness and functionality, housing arrow keys for enhanced usability. VIA support ensures seamless keymap customization to tailor the keyboard to your preferences.
