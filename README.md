hello, here I will share about my keyboard, so this is the first keyboard that I named mist65. I call it mist because the PCB is black which is identical to fog in the middle of the night and also the layout is 65%.
Long story short, I wanted a keyboard whose keymap could be changed, but because keyboards that supported it were very expensive on the market, I made my own version. Apart from that, because the price of the ATmega32u4 controller is very expensive on the market and difficult to find, I replaced the controller with the RP2040 Zero which is cheaper and easier to find but with relatively the same features. This keyboard is 65% in the category and family, because I wanted the keyboard to remain small but contain arrow keys. This keyboard was inspired by [Bakeneko65](https://github.com/kkatano/bakeneko-65) and I modified it to accommodate RP2040 Zero and VIA support. I hope you can experiment and really create a keyboard that suits your preferences. Previously I made a PCB which you can buy here ([link](https://github.com/kkatano/bakeneko-65)). Please if you want to use this design for group purchasing or commercial purposes.

go to the [wiki](https://github.com/naaeell/mist65/wiki) page for how to make it, function, and materials needed.
## Features

- No RGB (yes I called it a feature)
- Drag and drop flash firmware
- Staggered design
- VIA support (manually upload keyboard definition as it is currently not merged into the via branch)
- QMK running firmware
- Easy to make and obtain components (cheap of course, won't break your bank account)
