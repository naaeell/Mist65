Introducing Mist65, a 65% custom keyboard inspired by [bakeneko65](https://github.com/kkatano/bakeneko-65). The PCB, aptly named Mist, features a sleek black design reminiscent of nighttime fog. To keep costs reasonable, the ATmega32u4 controller has been replaced with the budget-friendly RP2040 Zero, maintaining similar functionality.

Designed with a 65% layout, Mist65 strikes a balance between compactness and functionality, housing arrow keys for enhanced usability. VIA support ensures seamless keymap customization to tailor the keyboard to your preferences.

For those interested, the Mist65 PCB is available for purchase [here](https://www.tokopedia.com/applemontea) (indonesian domestic). If considering group buy or commercial use, kindly adhere to the specified terms.
